# Exercise 4


1. Using test driven development, create a component and unit test that displays the following output.


```html
<footer>
  <small>
    &copy 2022, Some Company Name
  </small>
</footer>
```

The value for the year (2022) and the company name (Some Company Name) should be populated from the component model.

2. The company name should be an input. If the company name is not specified define some kind of default value.

3. Write the test before you write the component.

4. Ensure it works!
